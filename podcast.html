					The Thoughtful Millennial is a podcast about two self-proclaimed thoughtful millennials in their
					relentless journeys to becoming more socially conscious humans.
				</p>
				<p>
					The two unlikely friends chose very
					different paths: social entrepreneurship versus white-collar work; and they draw from these
					experiences (amongst others) to present refreshing views on the big philosophical questions of our
					times. The perspectives shared are drawn from diverse cultural, economic and professional
					backgrounds which molded the choices that led them to today. But through challenging each otherâ€™s
					unconscious bias, how might they change the course of tomorrow?
