A while ago I started therapy after an emotional breakup. Throughout this journey, I had the support to understand my emotions and feelings. However, even after some time I felt that there was still something I was unable to express.

During a difficuly session, I had the idea of creating doodles to let go of my negative emotions and to put on paper what I had learned during my therapy sessions. Then, I created the first draft of the experiences I was going through that I was unable to express in words. Being able to portray the mourning and the nostalgia of moving on with my life gave me the sense of peace I needed. 

After some weeks I had more drawings. I had not considered to show these comics to the world. I wanted to keep them for myself as a memory. However, throughout this journey, I had the chance to talk to friends about what I was experiencing. The conversations made me realise that I was not the only one that felt this way after a breakup. We all had felt it but most of us felt it difficult to explain these feelings.

After more conversations, I realised that my experiences may also be helpful to others that are going through similar situations. Maybe these comics would be a way to express what words could not. Maybe they can give us the relief to know that it is OK to feel all these emotions.

After some time, I got in touch with a good friend of mine [@dartvidgo](https://www.instagram.com/dartvidgo/). He is an artist that could give justice to the message I wanted to convey. After explaining the concept, he joined the project and we created Letting Go Comics. Since then, we released a comic every Monday starting in March 2021 and the series is now complete.

I'd like to thank everyone who supported us while creating and working on this comic. This project would not have been possible without your support.

The comics are also available in Webtoon [here](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/letting-go-comics/list?title_no=628509).
