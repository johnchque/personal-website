Subconscious Fallout is an album made in collaboration with Vishay Khxl. Together we worked for six months on an album that mixes rap, pop, and metal.
The album represents the journey of losing yourself. The strength it needs to be compassionate and understanding with your own thoughts.

Tracklist:
- "Memories of Us"
- "One Step at a Time"
- "Take One (Skit)"
- "Turning Point"
- "Senses"
- "Silver Mean (Interlude)"
- "The Hand of the Fallen"
- "My Decisions"
- "बदलाव"
- "Naked Sky (Outro)"

## Responsibilities

- Instrumentation with electric and acoustic guitars.

- Vocals for Memories of Us, One Step at a Time, Turning Point, Senses, The Hand of the Fallen, and My Decisions.
- Design of album and back cover.

## Achievements
