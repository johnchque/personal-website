My work on videography has explored multiple facets. It started when I joined TEDxUCB in 2019 as Production leader, later I started creating content on my Instagram account for travel vlogs, and currently I produce music videos.

My camera gear consists of a Nikon D5300 and a Canon M50. The software I use to edit these videos is KDEnlive. Additionally, I use Inkscape, GIMP, and Darktable for the pictures I include in the videos.

While working on the album subconscious fallout along with Vishay Khxl Music, I had the opportunity to produce 4 music videos.

## Vishay Khxl

Along with Vishay Khxl I had the opportunity to learn more and experiment with my videography skills. The videos I produced for these songs were result of days of preparation and using the available resources we had.
