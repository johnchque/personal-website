Since 1948 IAESTE has been providing young science and engineering students from around the world with paid, course related work experience. Similarly, IAESTE has been a source of high quality trainees for companies and institutions in more than 80 countries worldwide.

Since January 2018, I volunteer to the organization as the Commitee Leader of my city, La Paz in Bolivia. I am in charge of giving talks about the program to all local universitites, guide foreign students when they arrive my country and support applicants when needed.
