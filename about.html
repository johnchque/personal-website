				<h2>
					A little history
				</h2>
				<p>
					I was born and raised in El Alto, Bolivia. I grew surrounded by mountains in a young city located at
					4000 meters above the sea level.
				</p>
				<p>
					I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Systems Engineering at Del Valle University in La Paz,
					Bolivia and in 2014, I was awarded an exchange scholarship to Tokyo, Japan. This initial experience changed my
					way of looking at things and how I understood other cultures. I started learning Japanese and
					getting to teach English on campus.
				</p>
				<p>
					By 2016, I got accepted as an intern in Switzerland and I moved to Zurich to work for 7 months.
					During that time, I found my passion for Open Source technologies and community building. This
					experience
					led me to connect with Drupal communities around the world and create bonds with other communities.
					After going back to Bolivia, I joined Nucleo GNU/Linux, a study group of free software. This
					community opened new worlds to me in order to support others to also work abroad with Open Source
					and Free technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					My passion for Sustainability was later enhanced when I was selected for the Young Sustainable
					Impact program in Norway. Among more than 8000 applicants, 24 people were selected. Meeting so many
					motivated individuals gave me a new perspective on life. I was sure I wanted to become an advocate
					for sustainable causes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since then, I started creating multiple projects to use all the skills I had learned. I
					co-founded organizations tackling mental health, sustainability, and gender equality issues. I
					volunteered in organizations as a videographer, photographer, HR manager, and Community manager. And
					created my own podcast and songs.
				</p>
				<p>
					After living in 5 different countries, I am trying to find my place in Copenhagen, Denmark. I enjoy
					an active life.
