					It is unreal to know someone that I can love this much. Spending the last 8 months with you have been nothing but amazing. I love you, Li.
				</p>
				<p>
					These 8 months feel long and short. Long because it feels as if I knew you forever, as if I loved the beautiful person you are for years. Short because the more I spend time with you, the more I enjoy it and time flies away.
				</p>
				<p>
					During this time we had multiple adventures and each one has been greater than the last one. I don't know how can I love more someone that I already love sooo much.
				</p>
				<p>
					This first picture is my favorite together. Your smile on this one always reminds me of the moments I am next to you. I wish I could hold you next to me everyday.

					Thanks for being such amazing partner. For letting me be myself and for showing me your kindness. Your passion for science and everything you do motivates me to try new things. You are an inspiration, an amazing human, and the more I know about you, the more I love you.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the past 8 months my heart has felt as lucky as it can be. I am so grateful for having you in my life. I don't know what the future holds but I am sure that I can love you for long. I keep falling in love with you everyday. Thanks for being you, Li. Happy 8 months.
