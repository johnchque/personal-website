        Throughout my career I have explored the use and development of software
        to make a positive social impact from different perspectives. Such work
        has allowed me to explore areas of knowledge that I wouldn't have
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passions come from the goal of ensuring that technology is best used
        to create a sustainable future where society is inclusive and empowering
        for everyone. In this way, my work falls into the categories of ed-tech,
        health tech, computer ethics, free and open source software,
        pro-feminism, sustainability, and knowledge management.
