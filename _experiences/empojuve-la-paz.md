Empoderando Juventudes (Empowering Youth) is an organization that has the firm conviction to encourage Latin American youth to actively and cooperatively fight for peace, equity and social and environmental justice in our communities and our region through projects, activities where knowledge, skills, dreams and struggles are combined and strengthened.

My time in Empoderando Juventudes helped me understand the importance of social impact in a local scale. Engage with other motivated individuals who wanted to raise awareness in the population and learn more about the environmental crisis we are going through. It was for sure an amazing experience that would help improve our society.

## Responsabilities
During my time at Empoderando Juventudes, I was in charge of:
- Creating a website for the organization that included a Blog. Each member of the organization would write an article every week and I had to review the format and upload the articles. The website also includes a Members page that shows a list and information of each current member of Empoderando Juventudes.
- Manage the technical work of the webinars organized. I had to use streaming software (OBS Studio) to stream the events in the Facebook Page of Empoderando Juventudes. Make tests with the speakers and monitor their work during the live events.
- Leading the Environmental Commission within the organization. Guide a team of 10 people to create activities promoting an Environmental change in my city (La Paz, Bolivia).

## Achievements
- We organized a Photography Contest that got 100+ participants and increased around 800 likes in our Facebook page.
