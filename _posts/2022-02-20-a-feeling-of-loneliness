Feeling afraid. Scared of what the future will hold. Wondering if loneliness and being alone are even similar things.

Floating in space, the sky joins me in despair.

Will this feeling ever end? The emptiness inside keeps growing and nothing will stop it.

The sounds around remind me of what I hope to have. I breathe and the sky moves with me.

Rain stops and I find a short feeling of hope. Tomorrow is another day and things might be different.

I can only hope now.

I hope tomorrow is a new day.
