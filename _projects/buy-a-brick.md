Ever since I arrived to Copenhagen I spent endless hours at Station. Station, the student and innovation house is a former police station that was renovated to create a space where students can connect with each other and create a positive impact in society.

The "Buy a Brick" campaign was an effort to bring more donations to the organisation so more projects can be funded and more ideas can be developed. By buying a brick, you can get your name on a brick of the building and show your support to the community.

My contribution to the donation campaign was focused on producing 6 videos with various members of partners that work at the house. I was in charge of the initial recordings and review the content as well as the post production of the videos.

Here you can see all the videos I made.
