As 2021 comes to an end, I wanted to spend time reflecting about the past 12 months. This is my first public Year-end review, which is a common practice within the PKM/GTD community. And as always, I hope this somehow resonates with you.

2021 has been a crazy year, lots of changes around the world. And I know that many people are struggling with their jobs and health. So I want to be extra thankful now as I consider myself a privileged and lucky person.

I must say that even when the pandemic started, I didn't know how it would change things for me. Thankfully, there were few adjustments that I had to make and my work was not affected by it. I was able to get a scholarship to study in Austria, make a lot of improvements to OPENschool, start new initiatives, spend more time doing art, and learning A LOT. I must say that there were multiple times when I felt scared of the future. I was not completely sure about my decisions. And many times even afraid of some. But as my therapists told me time ago: "Right now, we are not the same people as we once were when we faced what we are afraid of. We have better emotional and psychological tools to be resillient". And I cannot agree more with that. This year was an emotional test for me.

Moving to another country is always exciting and scary. Trying to take your life to somewhere else is a difficult decision that requires a lot of personal understanding. Knowing what you can leave, what you want with you and why. I want to make this year-end review as intentional as possible, that was probably the most important point of this year.

I will start with the biggest change for this year.
