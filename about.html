					Most of my efforts are related to social entrepreneurship, software development and art. The
					combination of these three fields is always a challenge but worth every second. I spend my time
					creating links between fields that are not commonly related.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am currently doing a Master's in <a href="https://dclead.eu/" target="_blank">Digital
						Communication Leadership</a> at Aalborg University in
					Denmark. I am interested in the ethics behind algorithms and what are the implications of such
					matters in society.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also currently collaborate with <a href="https://www.openschoolsolutions.com/"
						target="_blank">OPENschool</a> by developing their platform. OPENschool is an organization that
					aims to change the ways how things work within the classroom by giving more freedom to children to
					decide what they want to learn and have the teachers as guides only.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before enrolling in this master's program, I worked for around 5 years as a software developer at
					<a href="https://www.md-systems.ch/en" target="_blank">MD Systems GmbH</a>, the top <a
						href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> contributor in Switzerland.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am an advocate of multidisciplinarity and self reflection. I worked in multiple other areas such
					as mental health awareness, sustainability, music, video production, and game design. You can see
					all my previous work <a href="/projects">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the side, I focus on developing my <a href="/blog">digital garden</a> where I upload my own
					essays and notes.

				<h2>
					A little history
				</h2>
				<p>
					I was born and raised in El Alto, Bolivia.
				</p>
				<p>
					I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Systems Engineering at Del Valle University in La Paz,
					Bolivia.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2014, I was awarded an exchange scholarship to Tokyo, Japan. This initial experience changed my
					way of looking at things and how I understood other cultures. I started learning Japanese and
					getting to teach English on the campus.
				</p>
				<p>
					By 2016, I got accepted as an intern in Switzerland and I moved to Zurich to work for 7 months.
					During that time, I found my passion for Open Source technologies and community building. This
					experience
					led me to connect with Drupal communities around the world and create bonds with other communities.
					After going back to Bolivia, I joined Nucleo GNU/Linux, a study group of free software. This
					community opened new worlds to me in order to support others to also work abroad with Open Source
					and Free technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					My passion for Sustainability was later enhanced when I was selected for the Young Sustainable
					Impact program in Norway. Among more than 8000 applicants, 24 people were selected. Meeting so many
					motivated individuals gave me a new perspective on life. I was sure I wanted to become an advocate
					for sustainable causes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since then, I started creating multiple projects to use all the skills I had learned. I
					co-founded organizations tackling mental health, sustainability, and gender equality issues. I
					volunteered in organizations as a videographer, photographer, HR manager, and Community manager. And
					created my own podcast and songs.
				</p>
				<p>
					After living in 5 different countries, I am trying to find my place in Copenhagen, Denmark. I enjoy
					an active life.
