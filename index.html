        I create impact-driven digital solutions with a deep commitment to sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have explored the use and development of software as a tool to make positive impact. My
        work falls into the categories of ed-tech, digital inclusion and accessibility, pro-feminism, computer ethics,
        and sustainability.
