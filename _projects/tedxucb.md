TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = an independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance, rules and regulations for the TEDx program.

During my time in TEDxUCB I was able to express myself more artistically. Being able to work with the speakers helped me understand their human side and by the work we did together at TEDxUCB our main task was to share this human aspect with all the participants of the event. It was an awesome experience that made me expand my network and show my artistic skills.

## Responsabilities
During my time at TEDxUCB, I was in charge of:
- Creating a website for the organization that included a page with the list of the members. The website also includes a page with the speakers that took part of the event, a small description of them and a link to their talks.
- Manage the production aspect of the event. Organise the venue, the stage and the camera work for recording the speakers. We have to make tests to set up the audio and lighting during the talks.
- Create an introduction video for the event that featured all the volunteers of TEDxUCB 2019. It was presented to start the event and it was produced by us.
- Create an introduction video for each speaker, introducing themselves or explaining a bit of what they do. Before each talk, the video was shown in order to give an introduction of the speakers to the public.

## Achievements
- Our event got an good reception, amazing feedback and is set to happen again in October 2020.
