I think sometimes in life we have to make decisions that are much harder than we expect. Times when we are not even sure if what we are doing is the best for us, but we take that step forward anyway.

Some time ago I went through a break up. It was something that for some reason left me more broken than I expected and I didn't know what to do with all the mess in my head. So I decided to go into therapy to understand my feelings and emotions. During this time I felt lost and tired of myself and I knew I had to change something.

I remember crying one afternoon when I came up with the idea of making doodles as a way of letting go of my own negative emotions and also as a way of putting down on paper what I had learned during my time in therapy. That was when I created the first draft of some thoughts about my experiences that somehow made me feel better. It was a way of making sense of all the things I was feeling and taking the time to think about why I was feeling that way.

As the days went by, making these doodles had a kind of therapeutic effect on me. As if I was taking everything I had in my head and creating something that expressed myself and my situation in a physical format. And I thought I wanted to keep them for myself as a memory.

After a few weeks, as I drew a bit more, I realised that maybe my experience would be helpful to others going through the same thing. Maybe these comics would be a way for them to express what they were feeling when words could not explain it. Maybe they could find relief from their feelings in these comics, just as I found relief in them. So I decided to release some of them to the public to let others know that it is OK to feel sad, broken and lost during this process.

At first I wanted to draw these comics myself, but I have to admit that even though I love to draw, I am really bad at it, so I thought that contacting someone with much more talent would do justice to the message I wanted to convey. So I contacted [@dartvidgo](https://www.instagram.com/dartvidgo/), a friend of mine who is an amazing artist and does a lot of illustrations. After explaining the concept, he joined the project and Letting Go Comics was born. Since then we have been releasing a comic every Monday since March 2021 and the series is now complete.

I'd like to thank everyone who supported us while creating and working on this comic. This project would not have been possible without your support.

The comics are also available in Webtoon [here](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/letting-go-comics/list?title_no=628509).
