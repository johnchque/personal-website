      <h1>Hi! I'm John Choque</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        I am a social entrepreneur, software developer, and artist.
      </p>

      <p>
        The core of my work lies somewhere between social entrepreneurship,
        software development and art. This combination has allowed me to explore
        diverse areas of knowledge that I would not have otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passions come from the goal of ensuring that technology is best used
        to advance society in an inclusive and empowering way. In this way, my
        work falls into the categories of ed-tech, computer ethics, pro-feminism
        anti-patriarchal, sustainability, free and open source software, and
        knowledge management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently a Senior Frontend Developer at
        <a href="https://dk.ecco.com/" target="_blank">ECCO</a>. Prior to this
        role, I worked for about 5 years as a Software Developer at
        <a href="https://www.md-systems.ch/en" target="_blank"
          >MD Systems GmbH</a
        >, the top <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> contributor in
        Switzerland. You can see all my previous experience
        <a href="/bio">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I like to <a href="/notes">learn on my own</a>, <a href="/world/">travel around the world</a>, and write poetry.
